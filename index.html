							<h2><strong> Information </h2></strong>

							<p><li>	Why providing ADHAAR number with your ITR is a better option?</li>

							<p>1.	There has been a provision in the form for ITR which asks you to send the physical copy of ITR-V to CPC Bangalore by speed post or by any other ordinary postal service despite which sometimes it is observed the forms remain undelivered resulting in <strong> Rejection </strong> of ITR</p>

							<p>2.	ADHAAR may be used to authenticate your e-filing making it easy for the department to acknowledge that you have duly filed your ITR and hence disposing off the process of sending the ITR-V to the Dept. making the process completely paperless. At present This Facility is available only to those Individuals who have income lesser than 5 Lacs per annum and do not have any refund during the current assessment year i.e. the year ending 31/03/2015 </P>

							<p>3.	Therefore it is advisable to provide your ADHAAR number as in near future this may benefit you as soon as the process of aligning the ADHAAR with ITR is accomplished.</p>
